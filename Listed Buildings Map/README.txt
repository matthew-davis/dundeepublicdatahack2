This Unity application lets you view listed buildings in the city of Dundee. Use the mouse to move the camera and click on pins to view information about them. The pins are coloured to indicate their listing category: red is A, yellow is B and green is C.

Because of file size I've only included the executable here. The full project can be found at https://github.com/mattstark256/listed-buildings-map
